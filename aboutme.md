title: About me
subtitle: Who am I?

My name is Tyler Doogan. I try to do a lot of things and end up doing most of them poorly. Quick bullets that better describe me:

- I am awkwardly tall and lanky
- I enjoy the company of cats
- I am a GNC Engineer by day
- I attempt to be a data scientist by night
- Most importantly, I enjoy doing math and puzzles

I'm not entirely sure what this page will soon become, other than a place to solve fivethirtyeight.com's riddler puzzles. For now it's basically just a complete rip off of Hector Pefo's page where he does the same thing but better.
